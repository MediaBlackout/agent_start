# MEDIA BLACKOUT LLC AI Orchestration Architecture

This document outlines how to expand the basic orchestration service in this repository into a fully functional AI system suitable for coordinating complex tasks across multiple specialized agents. The design leverages the existing `Orchestrator` and agent stubs as a starting point.

## Overview

The orchestrator coordinates a set of agents to accomplish high‑level goals. Each agent encapsulates a domain of expertise, exposing a simple interface (`execute` or `decide`). MEDIA BLACKOUT LLC can extend these agents to cover additional domains such as marketing, infrastructure, finance, and compliance.

```
Client -> FastAPI server -> Orchestrator -> [agents]
```

The main workflow is:

1. **Planning** – The orchestrator creates a plan for a given goal, optionally assisted by an LLM.
2. **Execution** – Each task in the plan is dispatched to the appropriate agent. Tasks can require approval before execution.
3. **Review** – Results of each task are summarized to determine whether the goal is complete.

## Adding New Agents

Create new Python classes under `agents/` implementing either an `execute` method (for actionable tasks) or a `decide` method (for decision making). Register the agent in `Orchestrator.__init__` by adding it to `self.agents`.

Example skeleton:

```python
# agents/marketing_agent.py
class MarketingAgent:
    """Handles marketing campaigns."""

    def execute(self, task: str) -> str:
        # Implement domain‑specific work here
        return f"[MarketingAgent] {task}"
```

```python
# orchestrator.py
from agents.marketing_agent import MarketingAgent
...
self.agents = {
    "marketing": MarketingAgent(),
    # existing agents
}
```

## Deployment

The FastAPI app in `app.py` exposes three endpoints:

- `POST /task` – begin orchestrating a new goal.
- `GET /status` – retrieve orchestrator state and log messages.
- `POST /approve` – approve or deny tasks that require confirmation.

Run the service locally with:

```bash
python app.py
```

MEDIA BLACKOUT LLC can containerize this service and deploy it to an environment of choice (e.g., AWS ECS or Kubernetes). Agents that interact with cloud resources should handle authentication via environment variables or IAM roles.

## Extending the Planner

The current planner stub returns a fixed list of tasks. To automate more complex planning, integrate a language model:

```python
import openai

prompt = f"Plan steps to achieve: {goal}."  # customize as needed
resp = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model="gpt-4", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}])
plan_text = resp["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
# parse `plan_text` into Task objects
```

This approach lets MEDIA BLACKOUT LLC dynamically generate plans for novel goals.

## Conclusion

Using the structure in this repository, MEDIA BLACKOUT LLC can develop a suite of cooperating agents managed by the orchestrator to accomplish high‑level objectives. Expand the agents and planning logic to cover the company’s operations, and deploy the FastAPI service to begin coordinating tasks.
